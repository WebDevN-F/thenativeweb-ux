The `Website` component acts as your root component when  building a content-driven, grid-based communication website. It will make sure the most basic things are available to you, like fonts and icons.

If you're building an interaction-driven, flexbox-based appliction layout use the `Application` component as your root component instead.

```js
<Website>
  <header>This header has the right font</header>
  <article></article>
  <footer></footer>
</Website>

```
